##  Installation

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


---

##  Sample Flow

1. Start the app:

i. Backend
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

ii. Frontend
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Enter a query like:

```
Suggest me an emotional Bollywood drama from the early 2000s
```

3. The system:
   - Extracts preferences from your message
   - Uses vector similarity to match movies
   - Displays the top 3 recommended titles

---

##  Recommendation Logic

- Uses **google/flan-t5-base** a open source free model for instruction-based parsing

- Uses **FAISS** to vectorize and match:
  ```
  metadata = title + genres + tags + mood
  ```
